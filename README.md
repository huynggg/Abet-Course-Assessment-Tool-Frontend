# Description

Each term, students and faculty enter data for each course they are enrolled
in/teach in the CSE department. This data is used to assess the department
courses for ABET accreditation. Near the end of the term, students are given a link
where they assess their CSE courses based on pre-specified course outcomes.
After the course is completed, instructors have data (including attachments) that
are provided. Reports are provided to the department Undergrad Curriculum
Committee and the Undergraduate Coordinator so that the courses can be
assessed according to the course and relevant program outcomes. There is a
current system, which is hard to use and hard to maintain. The program outcome
mappings are obsolete due to ABET changes, so a new version is needed.

This is the front-end for the Fall 2020 - Spring 2023 UNT ABET Tool Project
